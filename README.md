## 💡 Projects

Here are some of the projects I’ve worked on to showcase my development skills and to continuously challenge myself:

- **AR Furniture Website**: A website that enables users to visualize furniture in real-time using Augmented Reality (AR). This project enhances the user shopping experience by showing how products look in their own space.
- **Amazon Clone**: A simple clone of the popular e-commerce website **Amazon**, built with **HTML** and **CSS**. The project replicates the Amazon homepage layout, product sections, and styling. This helped me practice creating responsive and visually appealing pages using basic web design principles.
- **Instagram Clone**: A clone of the popular social media platform **Instagram**, built using **HTML** and **CSS**. This project focuses on replicating the layout, profile pages, and feed of Instagram, helping me understand the importance of responsive design and layout structure.
- **Netflix Clone**: A clone of **Netflix**, built with **HTML** and **CSS**. This project involves creating the Netflix homepage layout, including movie thumbnails, navigation bars, and user interface design, focusing on responsive grid layouts and user-friendly navigation.
- **Portfolio Website**: A personal website to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, it’s designed to demonstrate my web development and design abilities.
- **Weather Website**: A simple weather forecasting website that pulls data from a weather API. Built with **JavaScript** and **OpenWeatherMap API**, this project helped me practice API integration and real-time data fetching.
- **SGPA Calculator in C**: A **console-based SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average) calculator** built in **C**. The program takes user input for grade points of each subject, calculates the SGPA, and displays it. This project helped me practice basic input/output operations and calculations in C.
- **Tic Tac Toe in C**: A **console-based Tic Tac Toe game** built using **C Language**. This project enhanced my understanding of basic game logic, data structures, and handling user input in C.
